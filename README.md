# Zero2K8s
Starting from zero—playing with Kubernetes and AI tech.

## What’s This About?
Casual experiments with Kubernetes, AI, and maybe some blockchain. Started: March 8, 2025.

## Week 2: Base Stack

### Step 1: Setup Directory Structure
- **Goal**: Create subdirectories to organize Week 2’s components.
- **Command**: `mkdir terraform docker k8s ansible`
- **Result**: New dirs `terraform/`, `docker/`, `k8s/`, `ansible/` added to the repo root.
- **Validation**: Run `ls` to see `ansible  docker  k8s  LICENSE  notes  README.md  screenshots  terraform`.
